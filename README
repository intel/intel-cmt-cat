Overview
========

This software package provides basic support for 
Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM)
and Cache Allocation Technology (CAT).
This release supports last level cache occupancy monitoring and 
memory bandwidth monitoring on a per core or logical thread basis. 
MBM supports two types of events reporting local and remote
memory bandwidth.
Both events are reported on a per core or logical thread basis. 
Local memory bandwidth reports the bandwidth of a thread accessing 
memory associated with the local socket. 
In a dual socket system, the remote memory bandwidth reports the 
bandwidth of a thread accessing the remote socket.
The monitoring utility does not track application migration across 
cores as this would require scheduler integration. 
Instead, applications should be pinned to cores to track 
last level cache occupancy and memory bandwidth. 
Scheduler-integrated alternatives such as cgroups and perf are being
researched to track the application PID (and all associated TIDs) 
rather than static assignment. The monitoring utility currently 
associates a Resource Monitoring ID(RMID) per core or logical 
thread when it initially comes up.

The command line utility provides the necessary functionality to set 
up the CAT capabilities. The software provides flags to configure the
class of service (CLOS) and associate cores / logical threads with a 
class of service. The Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5 v3 generation 
supports four classes of service and a set of pre-defined 
classes of service that should not be changed at run time. 
Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D generation supports sixteen 
classes of service. There are no pre-defined classes of service and 
they can be changed at run time. 
Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5 v3 and Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D 
generations supports Core/Logical thread association with a 
class of service can be changed dynamically. 
CMT is supported on all Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5 v3 and 
Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D SKUs. 
CAT is supported on the following:
6 SKUs for Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E5 v3 family:
E5-2658 v3, E5-2648L v3, E5-2628L v3, E5-2618L v3, E5-2608L v3 and E5-2658A v3
2 SKUs for Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E3 v4 family:
E3-1258L v4 and E3-1278L v4
and all Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D SKUs.

Use of concurrent monitoring instances is possible as long as each
instance monitors exclusive set of cores. Library APIs are also thread safe.

For additional CMT, MBM and CAT details please see refer to the Intel(R) 
Architecture Software Development Manuals available at: 
http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html
Specific information with regard to CMT, MBM and CAT can be found in
Chapter 17.14 and 17.15.


Requirements and Installation
=============================

CMT, MBM and CAT are configured using Model Specific Registers (MSRs) 
to measure occupancy, set up the class of service masks and manage 
the association of the cores/logical threads to a class of service. 
The pqos software executes in user space, and access to the MSRs is
obtained through a standard Linux* interface. The virtual file system
structure /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr provides an interface to read and write
the MSRs. The msr file interface is protected and requires root
privileges. The msr driver might not be auto-loaded and on some
modular kernels the driver may need to be loaded manually:

$ modprobe msr

For installation of the PQoS utility untar the gzip image and follow
below instructions to create pqos executable.

To compile PQoS utility:
        "make" or "make all" for building utility (builds library if missing).
        "make all DEBUG=y" for building utility for debugging.
        "make rinse" for cleaning local build files.
        "make clean" for clearing even more files than "make rinse".

To install the PQoS utility (optional), first compile, then:
        "sudo make install" to install below /usr/local.
        "sudo make install PREFIX=/some/where" to install below /some/where.

To compile PQoS library:
        cd lib/
        "make help" lists various make options.
        "make" or "make all" for building static library.
        "make all SHARED=y" for building shared library.
        "make all DEBUG=y" for building static library for debugging.
        "make rinse" for cleaning local build files.
        "make clean" for clearing even more files than "make rinse".
        "make doxy" to create doxygen documentation.

Note:   In case of compilation error such as:
        "host_pidapi.c:46:30: fatal error: linux/perf_event.h:
         No such file or directory compilation terminated."
        compile the code without PID monitoring support:
        "make all NO_PID_API=y".
        This occurs on Linux kernels that do not support perf
        monitoring events.

To compile CAT, CMT and MBM sample applications:
        
For CAT sample application:
        cd lib/examples/CAT/
        "make all" for building static library.
        "make clean" for cleaning build files.
CAT sample application build will create three targets as follows:
1. allocation_app - Demonstrates usage of pqos library APIs related
to set bit mask for class of service(CLOS) and displaying 
class of service(CLOS) and associated bit mask.
Please refer "./allocation_app -h" option for usage details.
2. association_app - Demonstrates usage of pqos library APIs related
to association of class of service(CLOS) to cores and displaying 
class of service(CLOS) and core association.
Please refer "./association_app -h" option for usage details.
3. reset_app - Demonstrates usage of pqos library APIs related to
resetting all classes of service to system default bit mask.
Please refer "./reset_app -h" option for usage details.

For CMT/MBM sample application:
        cd lib/examples/CMT_MBM/
        "make all" for building static library.
        "make clean" for cleaning build files.
CMT_MBM sample application build will create one target as follows:
1. monitor_app - Demonstrates usage of pqos library APIs related
monitoring events like cache occupancy, local memory bandwidth usage 
and remote memory bandwidth usage. 
Please refer "./monitor_app -h" option for usage details.

        
Usage
=====

After compilation the PQoS executable can be used to configure the
last level cache allocation feature and monitor the last level cache
occupancy as well as memory bandwidth.

Usage: For pqos utility:
        "./pqos -h"    This option will display extensive help page.
                       Please refer to "-h" option for usage details.
        "./pqos -s"    Shows current CAT, CMT and MBM configuration.
        "./pqos -T"    Starts CMT and MBM monitoring on all detected
                       cores(depends of hardware feature availability).
