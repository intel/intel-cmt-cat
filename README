Overview
========

This software package provides basic support for
Intel(R) Resource Director Technology (Intel(R) RDT) including:
Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM),
Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) and Code and Data Prioritization (CDP).

In principle, the software programs the technologies via
Model Specific Registers (MSR) on a per core or hardware thread basis.
MSR access is arranged via standard operating system driver: msr on Linux and
cpuctl on FreeBSD. Presence of the technologies is detected via CPUID
instruction. In some cases CAT is detected via brand string read from CPUID.

Software detects presence of Linux perf extensions for
the monitoring technologies. In such case it enables library API's for
monitoring processes.

This software package is maintained, updated and developed on
https://github.com/01org/intel-cmt-cat

https://github.com/01org/intel-cmt-cat/wiki provides FAQ, usage examples and
useful links.

Please refer to INSTALL file for package installation instructions.

Software Compatibility
======================

In short, use intel-cmt-cat or Intel(R) PCM software together with
Linux perf and cgroup frameworks is not allowed at the moment.

As disappointing as it is, use of Linux perf for CMT & MBM and
intel-cmt-cat for CAT & CDP is not allowed. This is because
Linux perf overrides existing CAT configuration during its operations.

There are only two options to choose from in order to make use of CAT:
- intel-cmt-cat software for CMT/MBM/CAT and CDP (core granularity only)
- patch kernel with an out of tree cgroup patch (CAT) and
  only use perf for monitoring (CMT kernels 4.1+, MBM kernels 4.6+)

(1) pqos monitoring from intel-cmt-cat can detect other
    pqos monitoring processes in the system.
    rdtset from intel-cmt-cat detects other processes started with rdtset and
    it will not use their CAT/CDP resources.

(2) pqos from intel-cmt-cat can detect that Intel(R) PCM monitors cores and
    it will not attempt to hijack the cores unless forced.
    However, if pqos monitoring is started first and then
    Intel(R) PCM is started then the latter one will hijack monitoring
    infrastructure from pqos for its use.

(3) Linux cgroup is an out of tree patch
